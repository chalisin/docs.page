# Advanced

Here we detail some advanced features you can use in your docs.page documentation.

## Translations and Locales

If you want to provide translations of your documentation into another language, we now support this.

First edit the `sidebar` property of your  `docs.json`. Instead of an array, it should now be an object, with the locale names as keys.

You will also need to add a `locales` property, which is an array of your locale names.

For example, to add spanish translations, we would change the following config
```
/docs.json
{
    ...
    "sidebar": [
        "Overview": "/",
        "Installation": "/installation"
    ]
}
```
to
```
/docs.json
{
    ...
    "sidebar": {
        "english" : [
                        "Overview": "/",
                        "Installation": "/english/installation"
                    ],
        "spanish" : [
                        "Resumen" : "/",
                        "Instalaci√≥n" : '/spanish/installation'
                    ]
    },
    "locales": ["english","spanish"]
}
```
We would then of course have to change our directory structure to match this new sidebar config:
```
/docs
    /english
        /index.mdx
        /installation.mdx
    /spanish
        /index.mdx
        /installation.mdx
```

You can make similar changes to provide a prefix for versioned documentation.
